Cancer Treatment Cost Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the cost of cancer treatment for patients based on medical records, treatment details, and patient demographics. The model helps in understanding cost drivers, improving cost estimates, and providing financial insights for both healthcare providers and patients.

Features
Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparation of healthcare datasets, handling missing values, and encoding categorical data.
Modeling: Utilization of various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for cost prediction.
Evaluation: Performance assessment using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score.
Interpretability: Insights into key factors affecting treatment cost using feature importance analysis.
